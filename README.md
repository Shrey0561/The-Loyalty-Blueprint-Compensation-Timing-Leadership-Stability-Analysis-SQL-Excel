# The Loyalty Blueprint: Employee Retention Analysis (SQL + Excel)
> This project was completed independently to practice HR analytics techniques and develop entry-level retention analysis skills.

## TL;DR
**Problem:** HR needed to understand what *keeps* employees loyal, not just why they leave.

**Process:** Used **MySQL + Excel** to segment 1,470 employees by salary hikes, manager tenure, stock options, and job involvement.

**Result:**
 - **20% higher retention** among employees with long-tenured managers
 - **Salary hikes in the first 18 months** significantly increased 2-year loyalty
 - **Stock options & high job involvement** strongly correlated with long-term retention

**Takeaway:** Investing early in leadership stability, incentive timing, and employee engagement drives loyalty.

## Overview
Using a synthetic HR dataset of 1,470 employees, this project explores the key contributors to employee retention. SQL was used to segment loyalty patterns across compensation bands and engagement indicators, which were then visualized in Excel to help HR teams understand what keeps employees long-term.

## Key Questions Answered
 * Which salary hikes are most linked to retention?
 * Does income level influence employee loyalty?
 * How does manager tenure impact long-term retention?
 * Do stock options or job involvement improve loyalty outcomes?
 * What practical actions can HR teams take to retain employees?

## SQL Queries Preview
Example SQL queries used to calculate retention metrics (e.g., overall retention rate, segmentation by stock option level). These outputs were then visualized in Excel to support the dashboard insights.

## KPIs Tracked
 * **Total Employees:** 1,470
 * **Overall Retention Rate:** 83.88%
 * **Avg. Manager Tenure:** 4.12 years
 * **Avg. Salary Hike:** 15.21%

## Business Insights & Strategic Recommendations

### Salary Hike & Retention
 * **Insight**: Retention peaked for salary hikes between **17-19%**, but declined when increases exceeded 23%.
   
 * **Recommendation**: Align raise percentages with engagement efforts; compensation alone does not guarantee loyalty.

### Income Band & Loyalty
 * **Insight**: Higher income bands showed **89.2% retention**, compared to **71.39%** for lower bands.
   
 * **Recommendation**: Invest in total rewards and development opportunities for lower bands to sustain commitment.
 
### Manager Tenure
 * **Insight**: Employees with managers of **6+ years** had **89.95% retention**, the highest in the dataset.
 * **Recommendation**: Retain experienced managers and provide mentorship for new team leads. 

### Stock Option Level
 * **Insight**: Stock Option Level 2 yielded the strongest loyalty at **92.41%**.
 * **Recommendation**: Moderate, attainable incentive plans drive better retention than none or excessive perks.

### Job Involvement
 * **Insight**: High involvement (Level 4) showed **90.97% retention**, the lowest attrition overall.
 * **Recommendation**: Build employee autonomy and recognition practices to reinforce long-term engagement.

## Tools Used
 - **MySQL**: Calculated retention metrics and segmented employee cohorts
 - **Microsoft Excel**: Built dashboard visuals, KPIs, and pattern summaries

## What I'd Explore Next
To deepen this analysis in future work:
 * Map retention trends across different promotion cycles
 * Compare loyalty across hybrid, remote, and on-site roles
 * Cluster employees by loyalty signals to create HR personas

## What This Project Demonstrates
 * Exposure to end-to-end thinking from raw data to HR insight
 * Ability to use SQL and Excel to build functional, scalable dashboards
 * Understanding of HR levers behind retention beyond surface metrics
 * Practice turning analysis into business-aligned recommendations

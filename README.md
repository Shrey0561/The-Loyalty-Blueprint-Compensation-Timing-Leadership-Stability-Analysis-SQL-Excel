# The Loyalty Blueprint: Compensation Timing & Leadership Stability Analysis (SQL + Excel)
> A practical HR analytics case study focused on analyzing how compensation timing and leadership continuity shape employee loyalty outcomes using SQL-based segmentation and Excel dashboards.

## TL;DR
**Problem:** HR lacked clarity on how compensation timing and managerial continuity influence long-term employee loyalty.

**Process:** Used **SQL** cohort segmentation and **Excel** dashboards to analyze salary hike timing, manager tenure, stock incentives, and engagement levels across 1,470 employees.

**Result:** Employees with long-tenured managers (6+ years) showed **20%** higher retention, and salary hikes within the first 18 months significantly strengthened 2-year loyalty.

## Dashboard Preview
This Excel dashboard visualizes compensation timing bands, manager tenure clusters, and loyalty patterns to support structural HR decision-making.

## Overview
Using a synthetic HR dataset of 1,470 employees, this project reframes retention as a structural outcome of compensation design and leadership continuity. Rather than asking why employees leave, the analysis evaluates when and how incentive timing and managerial stability strengthen long-term loyalty.

## Key Questions Answered
 * How does compensation timing influence 2-year retention stability?
 * Does managerial tenure create measurable continuity effects on loyalty?
 * Are moderate incentive bands more effective than extreme compensation jumps?
 * Which structural levers strengthen retention beyond salary alone?

## SQL Queries Preview
Example SQL queries used to calculate retention metrics (e.g., overall retention rate, segmentation by stock option level). These outputs were then visualized in Excel to support the dashboard insights.

## KPIs Tracked
 * **Total Employees:** 1,470
 * **Overall Retention Rate:** 83.88%
 * **Avg. Manager Tenure:** 4.12 years
 * **Avg. Salary Hike:** 15.21%
   
> These metrics establish a baseline to evaluate how structural compensation and leadership decisions influence long-term retention stability.

## Business Insights & Strategic Recommendations

### Salary Hike & Retention
 * **Insight**: Retention peaked for salary hikes between **17-19%**, but declined when increases exceeded 23%.
   
 * **Recommendation**: Standardize early-career salary progression bands (17-19%) within the first 18 months to stabilize mid-tenure attrition risk.

### Income Band & Loyalty
 * **Insight**: Higher income bands showed **89.2% retention**, compared to **71.39%** for lower bands.
   
 * **Recommendation**: Introduce milestone-based compensation reviews and transparent progression frameworks for lower-income cohorts to prevent early-stage loyalty erosion.
 
### Manager Tenure
 * **Insight**: Employees with managers of **6+ years** had **89.95% retention**, the highest in the dataset.
 * **Recommendation**: Track managerial tenure as a retention KPI and implement structured transition plans when team leadership changes occur.

### Stock Option Level
 * **Insight**: Stock Option Level 2 yielded the strongest loyalty at **92.41%**.
 * **Recommendation**: Design attainable equity thresholds that reward sustained performance without creating disengagement gaps between incentive tiers.

### Job Involvement
 * **Insight**: High involvement (Level 4) showed **90.97% retention**, the lowest attrition overall.
 * **Recommendation**: Incorporate job-involvement scoring into performance reviews to detect declining engagement before loyalty erosion begins.

## Tools Used
 - **MySQL**: Calculated retention metrics and segmented employee cohorts
 - **Microsoft Excel**: Built dashboard visuals, KPIs, and pattern summaries

## What I'd Explore Next
To deepen this analysis in future work:
 * Map retention trends across different promotion cycles
